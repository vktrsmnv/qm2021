I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/). I hold a master’s degree in Political Science from the University of Mannheim, and I have earned my bachelor’s degree at [St. Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru/) and [Bard College](https://www.bard.edu/), majoring in International Relations and Politics. During my Master studies, I was a student assistant at the [American Political Science Review](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review). Currently, I'm working as a research associate at the [Chairs of Political Economy](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/braeuninger/) and [Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/gschwend/). My research interests lie in the intersection of political methodology and the politics of information, with a specific focus on statistical modeling and text and image analysis. Since Fall 2018, I have taught courses in academic writing, data analysis, and politics in authoritarian regimes for BA and MA students at the University of Mannheim.
