I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de) and a Research Associate at the [Chair of Political Science, Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/gschwend/) at the University of Mannheim. I hold a Master’s degree in Political Science from the University of Mannheim and a Bachelor’s degree in Social Sciences from the [Heinrich-Heine University of Düsseldorf](https://www.hhu.de). My current research focuses on the development and application of methods to automatically analyse large corpuses of video data with the goal to answer substantively meaningful questions in the field of political science in general, and legislative politics in particular. Moreover, I am interested in causal inference, with a special focus on the consequences of non-random sample selection for causal inference.
