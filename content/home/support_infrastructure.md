We are here to help

- **Office Hours:** We are always happy to help. Sign up for our virtual office hours.
  - From our experience we can best help if you come with a specific question in mind.
  - So if you want to attend our office hours, please sign up on ILIAS by 17h00 on Sunday,
with at least one specific question you want to have answered.
  - Given the number of people in the class, we might need to restrict the time we can offer
for each student.
- **ILIAS Forum:** We will use Teams for synchronous course communication. Feel free to post questions you need short and quick answers to there. Note that while Teams is great for quick clarifications, it's not a great venue for lengthy questions that require extended discussion.  
- **Email:** blablabla
- For more general support and advice, please make use of the following resources:
  - 

Make good use of this support system, it is there for you! And if you're not sure where to go for help, just ask any academic or administrative member of the course team.
