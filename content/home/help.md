### Ask questions during lectures and labs

If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

### Office hours

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments.  From our experience, we can best help if you come with a specific question in mind.

For time management reasons, if you plan to come to *Monday or Thursday (lab) office hours*, we ask you to please sign up by 17:00 on the day before (you can use the form below), with at least one specific question you want to have answered. You don't need to sign up for Tuesday office hours.  


### Slack 

Students regularly run into the same issues as one another, so it's helpful to ask these questions in a shared space. You are thus welcome to post questions in our [Slack workspace](https://qm2021.slack.com/), in the `#help` channel. You can ask questions and help each other out by answering questions of your peers. We will monitor the channel and try to respond to your questions there ASAP. 

### Email

If you have questions about personal matters that are not appropriate for the public space like Slack channels (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.), please don't hesitate to email us.
