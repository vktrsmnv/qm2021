# QM 2021

This is the website from for the course Quantitative Methods in Political Science (aka Multivariate Analysis) at the University of Mannheim. 

This site uses the [Academic Hugo theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/). There are some slight template modifications found in `/assets/` and `layouts/`.
Various hugo and blogdown features were borrowed more or less directly from [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com) and [Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/).
