### Midterm Info

- The midterm will be a 90-min closed-book exam. 
- You only need to bring a pen, your ID, and your Covid Pass (when writing in-person). The numbers you have to calculate will be easier than on the mock exam.
- Those who cannot be in Mannheim and got our approval will get a Zoom link shortly before the start and need to have their camera on so that we can live proctor you.
